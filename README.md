# NYSE-Data-Analysis

### Project Overview
Here are the objectives of this project:
- to perform data analysis and create a presentation to share findings observed;
- to develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, and
- to create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.

### Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from the 'projectdata-nyse.csv' file obtained from Udacity for educational purposes. This dataset encompasses financial information from the NYSE over a 4-year period.

### Tools
- Excel
- Powerpoint

### Project Goals
#### Task One
This was to identify the question about the data that will be answered in the course of analysing the data which must be included in a slide presentation and the question should include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub
Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics).

Given the factors relevant to the question, I selected 'Does the Total Revenue of the Industrials Sector exceed that of the Financial Sector for Year 4?' To address this inquiry, I conducted summary statistics analysis using Excel. The summary statistics encompass measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range), enabling me to answer the question.

As for data visualization, a bar plot was selected because it effectively represents categorical variables, as illustrated in the slide below.

Below are the summary statistics and the slide presentation with insights

#### Task Two
Create a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list.


To accomplish this, I utilized the INDEX and MATCH functions to retrieve values associated with each company. Additionally, the data validation tool was employed to create a drop-down list of companies. This list, in turn, pulls historical fundamentals data to generate the Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement. When a company is selected from the dropdown, its historical data is displayed, showcasing Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT values for all the years covered in the dataset with historical information for that specific company. Here is the image of the P & L Statement:


#### Task Three
Create a dynamic financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of your choice that forecasts out
the Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios.

In financial modeling, scenario analysis is employed to evaluate and predict potential future outcomes for a specific company based on its historical data. This analysis typically includes best-case, worst-case, and base-case scenarios. Below is the forecasting model for the ADS company, presenting Gross Profit, Operating Profit/EBIT for the next two years using these three scenarios, as illustrated in the image below:
